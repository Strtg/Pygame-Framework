# type here mod names and what you want (which directory) from that mod
# for example:
# awsomemod_1.3: all  # means you want all from that mod
# bigger_realism_0.1: frontend  # means you want only graphics and sounds from that mod
# subdirectories of typed directory are automatically loaded
# you can type more than one mod in new lines
# you can type the same mod more than ine time which is useful when you want to load more than one directories from the same mod
# mods are loaded one after another from top to bottom
# when a more than one mod modify the same things the mod loaded later will overwrite previous mod
# vanilla is always loaded as the first "mod" even when it is not typed here
